	<p><br>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users.Games (called "experiences" by the corporation) are made with a derivative of the language Lua named Luau.</p>
	
	
   <p>Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products".<br><br> The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.</p>
